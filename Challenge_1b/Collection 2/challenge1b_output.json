        "What’s the best way to create a PDF? \nYou can create PDFs from documents printed on paper, Microsoft Word documents, InDesign® \nfiles, digital images, and more. Diﬀerent types of sources have diﬀerent tools available for PDF \nconversion. In many applications, you can create PDFs by selecting the Adobe PDF printer in \nthe Print dialog box. \nIf a file is open in its authoring application (such as a spreadsheet that is open in Microsoft \nExcel), you can convert it to PDF without opening Adobe Acrobat. Similarly, if Acrobat is \nalready open, you don’t have to open the authoring application to convert a file to PDF. \nEvery PDF balances eﬃciency (small file size) and quality (such as resolution and color). If the \nbalance between the file size and the quality is critical to your task, you must use an \nappropriate conversion method. \nFor example, you can drag files to the Acrobat icon to create PDFs. In this case, Acrobat \napplies the most recently used conversion settings without providing access to those settings. \nIf you want more control over the process, you’ll want to use another method. \nPDF creation methods by file type \nRefer to the following lists to determine the methods available for the diﬀerent types of files. \nFile Type \nPDF Creation Methods \nAny file format \nMethod 1: From the top tools bar, select Create. Then, select a \nfile type and then select the file that you want to convert to \nPDF. \nOr, select the hamburger menu \n (Windows) or \nthe File menu (macOS)  > Create and then select the \nappropriate file type and follow through the steps.  \nMethod 2: Drag and drop a file from your system to the \nAcrobat Home page. \nMethod 3: Right-click on the file and then select Convert to \nAdobe PDF.",

On Windows, choose the hamburger   Menu > Undo, Redo & more > Revert. \nOn macOS, select the File menu > Revert. \nAbout the Autosave feature \nThe Autosave feature guards against losing your work in case of a power failure by \nincrementally, and at regular intervals, saving file changes to a specified location. The original \nfile is not modified. Instead, Acrobat creates an autosave file of changes, which includes all the \nchanges you made to the open file since the last automatic save. The amount of new \ninformation that the autosave file contains depends on how frequently Acrobat saves the \nautosave file. If you set the autosave interval to 15 minutes, you could lose the last 14 minutes \nof your work if a problem occurs. Frequent automatic saving prevents loss of data, and is \nespecially useful if you make extensive changes to a document, such as by adding comments. \nYou can apply autosave changes to the original files when you restart Acrobat. When you \nclose, save manually, or revert to the last-saved version of a file, the autosave file is deleted. \nNote:  \nIf you use assistive technology, such as a screen reader, you may want to disable the Autosave \nfeature so that you don’t lose your place when the file is reloaded. \nThe Autosave feature won’t work in the following cases: \n• \nA document that has its security changed. You must save the document to re-enable \nautomatic saving of document changes. \n• \nA document created using the Web Capture feature or extracted from a larger PDF \n(All tools > Organize Pages > Extract). You must save the document to enable \nautomatic saving of changes. \n• \nA document displayed in a web browser or incorporated into a container document \nthat supports Object Linking and Embedding (OLE).

To understand the governing terms, \nreview Adobe's Generative AI User Guidelines. To understand Adobe's data handling \npractices, see Content usage and handling practices. \n \nThe AI-powered features in Acrobat and Acrobat Reader support multiple document types, \nincluding PDFs, DOCX, PPTX, TXT, and RTF files. AI Assistant supports Microsoft Teams and \nZoom meeting transcripts. The capabilities improve comprehension and save time across \nvarious document types. \n \nAI Assistant quickly gets answers to your questions based on your documents in a \ncomprehensive and informative way. It can analyze multiple documents to uncover \nsimilarities, differences, and key patterns. With AI Assistant, you can make targeted requests, \nsuch as highlighting the differences between PDF contracts. It links to text and data table \nsources within the document. It also suggests follow-up questions for you based on the \nprimary question. AI Assistant uses the latest AI language model, GPT 4o, to provide more \naccurate and clear answers to your queries based on more citations. It can extract information \naccurately from tables and complex documents. \n \nGenerative summary automatically provides an outline with headings and summaries to \nhighlight key points in the document. The feature generates key insights that help you easily \ncomprehend the PDF content. For a speedier response, it processes PDF content in chunks \nand simultaneously streams summaries. \n \nYou can access the generative AI features in Adobe Acrobat Reader, Adobe Acrobat desktop \non both Windows and macOS, on Acrobat online, and within Acrobat extensions for Google",
        "Chrome or Microsoft Edge. AI Assistant is also available on phones through Acrobat mobile \napps (iOS and Android). It isn't available on iPad or Android tablets.  \n \n \nBenefits of generative AI features \nThe generative AI features in Acrobat and Acrobat Reader significantly improve \ncomprehension, help you get insights, and produce high-quality content quickly. Here are the \nmain benefits. \n \n- \nImproved comprehension: You can better understand complex PDF documents \nbecause the features provide insights and more context around the content. \n- \nEnhanced productivity: Work across multiple PDFs and documents in various formats, \nincluding Teams and Zoom meeting transcripts, streamlining your workflow and \nsaving time for higher-priority tasks. \n- \nImpactful content: You can use the content suggestions that the features generate for \nimpactful emails, presentations, meeting notes, and more. \n \nTurn off generative AI features \nThe generative AI features in Acrobat and Acrobat Reader are turned on by default. However, \nyou can choose to turn them off, if necessary. If you're an admin, you can revoke access to \ngenerative AI features for your team or org by contacting Adobe Customer Care. \n \nUser Guidelines \nUser Guidelines governing your access and use of Acrobat and Acrobat Reader generative AI \nfeatures are found here. \nIn addition, please always use your judgment to evaluate generated output and any source \nattributions. Acrobat and Acrobat Reader generative AI features are built upon powerful, \nemerging large language model technologies that may generate outputs that are inaccurate \nor misleading, or otherwise reflect content that does not represent Adobe’s views. This is \nespecially true if you try to use these features to generate outputs that are unrelated to your \nsource document.   \nDo not use generative AI features to seek legal, medical, financial, or other kinds of \nprofessional advice or any opinions, judgments, or recommendations without conducting \nyour own independent consultation or research. Generative AI features cannot replace \nadvice provided by a qualified professional and do not form any such relationship (for \nexample, an attorney-client relationship).  \nAttributions \nWhen the AI Assistant analyzes a document, it identifies sentences most likely to support the \nanswer to your question. Attribution can take the form of clickable citations or other helpful",
        "cues indicating where generated information came from. However, because the AI Assistant is \npowered by generative AI models, and the technology is still evolving and not perfect, not all \nanswers are helpful or accurate. As a result, the AI Assistant may not find and display answers \nto your questions — even when the information is in your document. And rarely, the AI \nAssistant may provide incorrect attributions. For example, you may receive a clickable citation \nor cue that takes you to an unrelated section instead of providing helpful information on \nwhere the answer came from in the document. Please double-check all AI-generated \nresponses. \nPlease note that in our current version, if the language of the question and response is \ndifferent than the language of your document, AI Assistant won't provide any attribution. In \nsuch scenarios, you can try asking questions in the language of the document to receive \nclickable citations in the response.  \nFeedback \nWe provide a feedback mechanism directly within the AI Assistant to help us improve \naccuracy and other performance issues. This is an ongoing process, and we will continue to \nwork together with our customers and community to harness the power of this new \ntechnology responsibly. \nContent usage and handling practices \nThis FAQ addresses Adobe’s content usage and handling practices specific to improving \ngenerative AI capabilities in Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Acrobat Reader.

A \nuser must first activate the generative AI feature set through a one-time “Getting Started” in-",
        "app experience as described above. After activation, a user must engage AI Assistant or \ngenerative summary on a specific file before processing takes place. \nNote:  \nThe generative AI features are only available in English for users with Individual or Teams \nentitlements. Users with Enterprise entitlements may only receive Acrobat generative AI \nfeatures when their admin assigns them with a paid or trial license, or if they are accepted into \none of the programs in our private beta.   \nYou can disable the generative AI feature by following the steps outlined here. Once disabled, \nno documents will be processed through generative AI in Acrobat until you activate the \nfeature set again. \nWhat LLMS are we leveraging to power generative ai in acrobat? \nWith AI Assistant in Acrobat and Acrobat Reader, Adobe takes an LLM-agnostic approach, \nselecting best-in-class technologies that address a range of customer use cases. We currently \nhave integrated the Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service with our proprietary technologies to \nprovide generative AI capability in Acrobat and Acrobat Reader. \nDoes adobe concurrently train any large language models (“LLMS”) with your content \nwhile you're using generative ai features in acrobat? \nNo. Acrobat does not train any LLMs on your content concurrent to your interactions with \ngenerative AI in Acrobat. Prompts provided to AI Assistant do not modify the underlying \nmodel. Your content will not be used to train any LLMs that deliver Acrobat’s generative AI \ncapability. For more information, please refer to the questions above in this help section \n(Content Usage and Handling Practices). \n \nNote:  \nAdobe does not use content from an organization or school account for product \nimprovement for generative AI unless otherwise agreed to by the organization or school. \n \nManaging chat history \nWhat is chat history? \nAcrobat now allows you to reference past conversations you had with AI Assistant. Chat \nhistory includes your textual prompts and generated responses for a specific document or a \nset of documents you selected, also termed a Collection. \nHow can I see my chat history? \nChat history includes your past conversations with AI Assistant and is linked to either a single \ndocument or a Collection.

        "Adobe LiveCycle Rights Management \n(ALCRM) servers \nAdobe LiveCycleRights Management (ALCRM) servers let you define centralized policies to \ncontrol access to documents. The policies are stored on the ALCRM server. You require server \naccess to use them. \nALCRM servers embed user access information in documents. Therefore, specify document \nrecipients in ALCRM policies. Alternatively, let the ALCRM server retrieve the list of recipients \nfrom LDAP directories. \nUse ALCRM servers to set permissions for separate document tasks, for example opening, \nediting, and printing. You can also define document auditing policies on ALCRM servers. \n \nWhat is a digital signature? \nDigital signatures are a secure and efficient way to electronically sign and authenticate \ndocuments, ensuring their authenticity and integrity. By using digital signatures, you can sign \ndocuments quickly and easily, and be confident that they can’t be tampered with or forged. \n \nWhy validate a digital signature? \nWhen you receive a signed document, you may want to validate its signature to verify the \nsigner and the signed content. Depending on how you’ve configured your application, \nvalidation may occur automatically. Signature validity is determined by checking the \nauthenticity of the signature’s digital ID certificate status and document integrity. \nTo verify authenticity, the validator checks if the signer's certificate or its parent certificates are \ntrusted. The validity of the signing certificate is also checked based on the user's Acrobat or \nAcrobat Reader settings. \nTo verify document integrity, the validator checks if the signed content was altered after \nsigning. If changes were made, the verification ensures that the signer allowed the changes.",

When Digital Signatures are \nvalidated, an icon appears in the document message bar to indicate the signature status. \n1.

In the 'Signature Verification Preferences' dialog that opens, you can control the \nfollowing settings:  \n• \nSet automatic validation of signatures: With the Verify signatures when the \ndocument is opened check box selected, Acrobat automatically validates all \nsignatures in a PDF when you open the document. \n• \nSet verification behavior: The options specify methods that determine \nwhich plug-in to choose when verifying a signature. The appropriate plug-in \nis often selected automatically. Contact your system administrator about \nspecific plug-in requirements for validating signatures. \n• \nCheck the revocation status of certificates: With the Require certificate \nrevocation checking to succeed... checkbox selected, Acrobat checks \ncertificates against a list of excluded certificates during validation.

It uses the time \nmentioned in the timestamp or embedded in the signature, even if the \nsignature’s certificate has expired. If you deselect the check box, Acrobat \ndiscards expired timestamps. \n• \nSet verification for time: You can select the appropriate options under \n'Verification time' to check the time at which the signature was created, to \ncheck the timestamp embedded in the signature, or to check the current \ntime.  \n• \nAdd verification information: Select appropriate options under 'Verification \ninformation' to add verification information to the signed PDF or to alert the \nuser when the verification information is too large. \n• \nConfigure to trust the root certificates in the Windows® certificate store: \nYou can specify whether to trust all root certificates in the Windows® \nCertificates store for: \n• \nValidating signatures: Certificates are trusted for Acrobat Approval \nsignature validation. \n• \nValidating certified documents: Certificates are trusted for \ncertification signature validation. \nNote: Selecting these options can compromise security. \n \nSet the trust level of a certificate \nIn Acrobat or Acrobat Reader, the signature of a certified or signed document is valid if you \nand the signer have a trust relationship. The trust level of the certificate indicates the actions \nfor which you trust the signer. \nYou can change the trust settings of certificates to allow specific actions. For example, you can \nchange the settings to enable the dynamic content and embedded JavaScript™ within the \ncertified document. \n1.

In the Edit Certificate Trust dialog that opens, select any of the following items to \ntrust the certificate: \n• \nUse this certificate as a trusted root: A root certificate is an originating \nauthority in a chain of certificate authorities that issued the certificate. By \ntrusting the root certificate, you trust all certificates issued by that certificate \nauthority. \n• \nSigned documents or data: It acknowledges the identity of the signer. \n• \nCertified documents: It trusts documents in which the author has certified the \ndocument with a signature.
